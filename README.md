# Kings

An Alexa skill that allows users to play a game of kings, even when there isn't a deck of cards on hand.


## Game rules

Take turns clockwise. Each player should draw a card on their turn, and follow the appropriate actions for that card (see below). Players may choose to have a beverage handy, and to have a cup in the center--the King's Cup. The game ends when all cards run out of the deck. The user will then have the option to start a new game.


## Prompts

The game starts when the user prompts the skill for a card--the app will subsequently shuffle through a full deck, and let the user know when the game is done. The user then has the option to start another game, or exit.
